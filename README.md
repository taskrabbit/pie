# pie.js

Pie is a set of resources I use to develop fast, independent web applications. It's not a framework because frameworks aren't cool anymore, but pie is cool.

### Dependencies

Hm, none.

### Usage

Check out the getting started doc or step through the annotated source.

### What does it look like?

Kinda mvc-ish, there's an app object, views, router, i18n, resource loader, models, ajax interface, native extensions, etc.

### How big is it?

Excuse me? It's ~100k before gzip, 30k after gzip.

### Work on pie too

Build pie locally, as you develop.

```bash
> npm install -g uglify-js
> npm install -g docco
> make watch
```

Run the specs / example app.

```base
> node server.js
> open http://localhost:5000/specRunner.html
> open http://localhost:5000/docs/guide
```
