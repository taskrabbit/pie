  <h1>Views</h1>

  <p>[%= project %] views exist to make DOM interaction simple. A view has an <em>el</em> by which all DOM manipulation, creation, and observation is conducted. Views are equipped with an <em>emitter</em> which is a simple pubsub interface. It's existence is vital to the usability of views in [%= project %]. Without it, you end up with random callbacks, assumptions about child implementations, and overall horrible architecture.</p>

  <p>[%= project %] comes equipped with a few different types of views:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <code>pie.view</code>
      <span>- a simple DOM wrapper enabling management of events, observation of models, etc.</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>pie.activeView</code>
      <span>- a pie.view with templating functionality. More on templating later.</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>pie.formView</code>
      <span>- a pie.activeView designed to standardize and enhance the behavior of forms.</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>pie.listView</code>
      <span>- a pie.activeView design to simply the management of lists.</span>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>pie.view</h3>
  
  <p><code>pie.view</code> is the most rudimentary implementation of DOM management in [%= project %]. It's purpose is to provide a way to easily and efficiently query, observe, and update DOM.</p>
